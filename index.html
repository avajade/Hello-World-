    <p> Html is the standard for designing your very own webpage. It also describes what is going on in the structure of your page. Html consists of many elements used to tell your browser how to display the information you put into the code.  </p>

        When I was little I always wanted to learn how to code and was super fascinated by everything that has to do with it. When I saw this course as an option it caught my attention and I was intrigued right away.
